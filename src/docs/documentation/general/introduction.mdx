## What is Bookiza?

Bookiza is a ~~book-writing~~ **book-making** tool. 

Create first class books for the web and cut down your publishing and delivery time by half. By half, no less! Bookiza will manage your manuscript smartly and bake-in all the goodness of the web into your book. And all the goodness of a book into your story.

Using Bookiza for developing books is like using any other application framework for developing apps, except here the story and the formatting of the longform i.e. the book _is_ the end goal. You can call it 'book development' for the web, but traditionally, in the physical realm, this art is known as [bookbinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookbinding). ðŸ˜‡

Print delightful books on web for everyone and not just those who own a Kindle or an iPad. See [support](https://bubblin.io/support) information for broader picture.

## Who is it for?

Professional writers, comics or magazine makers and artistsâ€”ala, people who publish longform regularly.

Bookiza uses the terminal environment (shell) to work. If you're uncomfortable about using shell commands or don't understand what a terminal app is, consider using Bubblin's in-browser [book editor](https://bubblin.io/docs/setup) instead.
