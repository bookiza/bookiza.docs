## What is Bookiza?

Bookiza is a *book reification framework* that cuts down your book writing and publishing time by half. By **half**, no less! Manage your manuscript smartly and bake in all the goodness of web inside your book. Using Bookiza is like app development, where the story _is_ the app. You can call it 'book development' for the web, if you will. ðŸ˜‡

Print delightful books on web for everyone and not just those who own a Kindle or an iPad. See [support](https://bubblin.io/support) information for broader picture.

## Who is it for?

Professional writers, comics or magazine makers and artistsâ€”ala, people who publish longform regularly.

Bookiza uses the terminal environment (shell) to work. If you're uncomfortable about using shell commands or don't understand what a terminal app is, consider using Bubblin's in-browser [book editor](https://bubblin.io/docs/setup) instead.


## Principles

1. Random access
2. Pagewise reference accessibility.
3. Hard pagination instead of faux.
4. Intuitive and highly customizable page turns.
5. Full HTML, CSS and JS support per page.
6. Line-tracking enabled
7. Responsive with support from Apple Watch to OLED TVs.
