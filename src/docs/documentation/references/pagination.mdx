# Pagination


Superbook lives and scales on web. Like a stack of well formed paginated webpages. 
all readers around the planet get to see the same content on a given page number. People don’t have to worry about the file format, device compatibility, underlying tech or the software required to be to view the book properly. No specialized (and proprietary) hardware is required either.

One—a reader like me gets to know the page number my friends are on and two—everyone can finally be on the same page—so there are fewer disagreements.
